# Copy of node-red-contrib-netatmo-dashboard, only smartly modified to work with Homecoach
[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation) node to fetch all data (temperature, pressure, humidity, co2, noise, etc) from a NetAtmo homecoach device.

Returns a payload which is split up into to parts: 

* a compact object which contains the most relevant information
* a detailed object which contains the complete return from the netatmo api

__Attention: The reachable status of the complete station seems not to changefor at least a 
couple of hours. While the reachable status of devices change after approximately 1h, 
the station itselve will shown as reachable even if this is not the case__

## Authentication
Use new NetAtmo authentication (from October 2022). From [Netatmo Connect](https://dev.netatmo.com/) obtain: *client_id*, *client_secret* and *refresh_token*.
To get the refresh_token a OAuth2 client is needed (i.e. [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) for MacOS): use these params
[Update - refresh token is available too from dev.netatmo.com]
* client_id: from your app in Netatmo Connect
* client_secret: from your app in Netamo Connect
* Authorization URL: https://api.netatmo.com/oauth2/authorize
* Access URL: https://api.netatmo.com/oauth2/token
* Redirect URL: http://localhost
